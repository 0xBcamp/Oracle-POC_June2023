# Oracle POC

## Description

This is a POC for an EVM based blockchain oracle implementation. The oracle is implemented as a smart contract that can be deployed on any EVM based blockchain. The oracle is able to fetch data from a remote server and store it on the blockchain. The oracle can also be queried to fetch the data from the blockchain network itself. My main goal here is to implement a simple POC that only supports two operations at the current stage:

-   Fetch data from a remote server and use it within the smart contract
-   Automate the process of fetching data from the remote server and using it within the smart contract
